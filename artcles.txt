Black Holes
The term black hole is of very recent origin. It was coined in 1969 by the American scientist John Wheeler as a graphic
description of an idea that goes back at least two hundred years, to a time when there were two theories about light:
one, which Newton favored, was that it was composed of particles; the other was that it was made of waves. We now
know that really both theories are correct. By the wave/particle duality of quantum mechanics, light can be regarded as
both a wave and a particle. Under the theory that light is made up of waves, it was not clear how it would respond to
gravity. But if light is composed of particles, one might expect them to be affected by gravity in the same way that
cannonballs, rockets, and planets are. At first people thought that particles of light traveled infinitely fast, so gravity
would not have been able to slow them down, but the discovery by Roemer that light travels at a finite speed meant that
gravity might have an important effect.
On this assumption, a Cambridge don, John Michell, wrote a paper in 1783 in the Philosophical Transactions of the
Royal Society of London in which he pointed out that a star that was sufficiently massive and compact would have such
a strong gravitational field that light could not escape: any light emitted from the surface of the star would be dragged
back by the star’s gravitational attraction before it could get very far. Michell suggested that there might be a large
number of stars like this. Although we would not be able to see them because the light from them would not reach us,
we would still feel their gravitational attraction. Such objects are what we now call black holes, because that is what
they are: black voids in space. A similar suggestion was made a few years later by the French scientist the Marquis de
Laplace, apparently independently of Michell. Interestingly enough, Laplace included it in only the first and second
editions of his book  The System of the World, and left it out of later editions; perhaps he decided that it was a crazy
idea. (Also, the particle theory of light went out of favor during the nineteenth century; it seemed that everything could
be explained by the wave theory, and according to the wave theory, it was not clear that light would be affected by
gravity at all.)

space and time
Our present ideas about the motion of bodies date back to Galileo and Newton. Before them people believed
Aristotle, who said that the natural state of a body was to be at rest and that it moved only if driven by a force or
impulse. It followed that a heavy body should fall faster than a light one, because it would have a greater pull
toward the earth.
The Aristotelian tradition also held that one could work out all the laws that govern the universe by pure
thought: it was not necessary to check by observation. So no one until Galileo bothered to see whether bodies
of different weight did in fact fall at different speeds. It is said that Galileo demonstrated that Aristotle’s belief
was false by dropping weights from the leaning tower of Pisa. The story is almost certainly untrue, but Galileo
did do something equivalent: he rolled balls of different weights down a smooth slope. The situation is similar to
that of heavy bodies falling vertically, but it is easier to observe because the Speeds are smaller. Galileo’s
measurements indicated that each body increased its speed at the same rate, no matter what its weight. For
example, if you let go of a ball on a slope that drops by one meter for every ten meters you go along, the ball
will be traveling down the slope at a speed of about one meter per second after one second, two meters per
second after two seconds, and so on, however heavy the ball. Of course a lead weight would fall faster than a
feather, but that is only because a feather is slowed down by air resistance. If one drops two bodies that don’t
have much air resistance, such as two different lead weights, they fall at the same rate. On the moon, where
there is no air to slow things down, the astronaut David R. Scott performed the feather and lead weight
experiment and found that indeed they did hit the ground at the same time.

A well-known scientist (some say it was Bertrand Russell) once gave a public lecture on astronomy. He
described how the earth orbits around the sun and how the sun, in turn, orbits around the center of a vast
collection of stars called our galaxy. At the end of the lecture, a little old lady at the back of the room got up and
said: “What you have told us is rubbish. The world is really a flat plate supported on the back of a giant
tortoise.” The scientist gave a superior smile before replying, “What is the tortoise standing on.” “You’re very
clever, young man, very clever,” said the old lady. “But it’s turtles all the way down!”
Most people would find the picture of our universe as an infinite tower of tortoises rather ridiculous, but why do
we think we know better? What do we know about the universe, and how do we know it? Where did the
universe come from, and where is it going? Did the universe have a beginning, and if so, what happened before
then? What is the nature of time? Will it ever come to an end? Can we go back in time? Recent breakthroughs
in physics, made possible in part by fantastic new technologies, suggest answers to some of these
longstanding questions. Someday these answers may seem as obvious to us as the earth orbiting the sun – or
perhaps as ridiculous as a tower of tortoises. Only time (whatever that may be) will tell.
As long ago as 340 BC the Greek philosopher Aristotle, in his book On the Heavens, was able to put forward
two good arguments for believing that the earth was a round sphere rather than a Hat plate. First, he realized
that eclipses of the moon were caused by the earth coming between the sun and the moon. The earth’s
shadow on the moon was always round, which would be true only if the earth was spherical. If the earth had
been a flat disk, the shadow would have been elongated and elliptical, unless the eclipse always occurred at a
time when the sun was directly under the center of the disk. Second, the Greeks knew from their travels that
the North Star appeared lower in the sky when viewed in the south than it did in more northerly regions. (Since
the North Star lies over the North Pole, it appears to be directly above an observer at the North Pole, but to
someone looking from the equator, it appears to lie just at the horizon. From the difference in the apparent
position of the North Star in Egypt and Greece, Aristotle even quoted an estimate that the distance around the
earth was 400,000 stadia. It is not known exactly what length a stadium was, but it may have been about 200
yards, which would make Aristotle’s estimate about twice the currently accepted figure. The Greeks even had a
third argument that the earth must be round, for why else does one first see the sails of a ship coming over the
horizon, and only later see the hull?

Still can't believe how quickly time is flying, I've been in Queenstown 3 weeks.

So went out Monday night after work on the 'blindfold barcrawl' in the snow which was hilarious. You are blindfolded on the walk between the bars and you have to hold onto a rope and follow the person in front. So we got to do this at night, in the snow with people falling over, soaked to the bone, throwing snowballs at eachother etc. Was really good fun. Met up with the group of lads who are staying in the dorm next door to me and we then spent the whole of Tuesday drinking as well, I tried going to work at 4pm, only to be ill, make a round of tea for everyone then be told to go home, where we went out again! The only food I managed to keep down was a mcdonalds cheeseburger at 2 in the morning. So today was a bit of a death day, sleep, fergburger, watching the local businessmen dress up in drag and run an obsticle course. Standard.

Quiet one in tonight, so I can actually go boarding seeing as there is fresh snow, do a whole shift at work and out afterward.
